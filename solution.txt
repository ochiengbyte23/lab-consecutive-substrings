Please add your pseudocode to this file

1.Intialise an array called result.

2. get the length of the input string.

3. Start outer loop A from index i = 0 to the last index.

4. Start inner loop B from index j = i + 1 to the last index.

5. Slice the string from index i up to index j.
   Add the sliced values to the result array.

6. Return result array.


And a written explanation of your solution
1. Create an empty aarray to store all the substrings created.
2. Find the length of the string in order to control where the loops will end.
3. Inner Loop A moves through the string caracter by character until the end with i representing where the substring begins.
4. Outer Loop B moves through the string caracter by character with j representing where the substring begins. j must be right after i.
5. During every step of the inner loop, slice the string from the curren i to the current j. The slice is then added to the result array.
6.When both loops are done running, returnthe array.
